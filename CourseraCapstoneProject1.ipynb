    "# Coursera Capstone Project: Environmental Issues In New York City.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### New York City, the largest city in the United States of America, faces a large and growing number of environmental problems ranging from sewage overflows to high air pollution. In this project, I will be comparing the environmental issues of several neighborhoods in New York City while taking into account what the issues are and how they can potentially be resolved by making suggestions using data from other cities and neighborhoods that do not have these environmental problems or do have them but on a much smaller scale. Environmental issues have a negative impact on tourism, business, housing and other industries. When it comes to tourism, people generally want to visit nicer areas that have clean air and a clean, elegent environment. Places that have high toxicity levels along with having a polluted, dirty environment are less likely to attract tourists. A lack of tourism will have negative impacts on businesses. Less people coming to a city will cause hotels, resturaunts, grocery stores and all sorts of businesses to experience a lack of customers and profits. A toxic environment will also have a negative impact on the housing market because less people will move to that area which means less houses will be sold."

The New York City government announced in 2017 that it is planning to cut %80 of carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2050. It has been reported that luxury towers are responsible for nearly %70 of all carbon emissions in the city. A solution to the problem is underway by the city government as they are trying to pass legislation that would require large buildings to significantly cut down on their use of energy.
